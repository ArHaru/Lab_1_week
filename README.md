# Lab_1_week

3_1 - taking this folder and loop through all it's folders and files, after what print them

3_2 - taking file or directory and using if, elif, else we define it as a file or folder 
("test -d $fileOrDir" the same if we wrote "[ -f $fileOrDir ]")

3_3 - using while cycle we print the remainder of our number until it becomes zero
("let number=$number/10" the same if we wrote "number=$(($number/10))")

3_4 - "wc -l" prints number of lines and files name, but using "<" we will print only number of lines
